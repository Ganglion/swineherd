h1. SwineHerd

* Provides a sane and uniform interface for running "Pig":http://hadoop.apache.org/pig, "Wukong":http://github.com/infochimps/wukong, and "R":http://www.r-project.org/ scripts
* Scripts can run themselves idempotently
* Scripts are always treated as templates so variable substitution is easy

h3. Outline

* A script has a source
* A script has parameters (used as command line args)
* A script has optional attributes (used for variable substitution)
* A script has one or more outputs
* A script can describe the command required to run it
* A script can run itself idempotently
* A script can run itself forcefully

h3. Working Example

See @examples/pagerank/pagerank.rake@ for a fully working example. To run it do:

<pre><code>
cd examples/pagerank
hadoop fs -mkdir /tmp/pagerank_example
hadoop fs -put data/seinfeld_network.tsv /tmp/pagerank_example/
rake -f pagerank.rake cut_off_adjacency_list -- --iterations=5
</code></pre>

For an alternative way of running using the @workflow@ class try @./pagerank.rb --flow_id=1234 --iterations=5@

h3. Future

The goal is to eventually bundle multiple scripts into workflows (right now done naively with rake, see pagerank example). These workflows
should have the following properties:

* A workflow has a unique id
* A workflow is idempotent (if only because its tasks are idempotent)
* A workflow has many tasks
* A workflow describes the commands required to run it
* A workflow can be described by a directed graph
