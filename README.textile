h1. SwineHerd

A "swineherd":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swineherd with a magic ruby to make pig fly.

...

maybe come back later?
        
<pre><code>
pigs-fly --maybe --output=/output_data --schema=/erb_load_schema some_pig_script.pig.erb
</code></pre>


Right now you need 3 things to create a pig script in this frameworks:

1. Need to write the body of the pig script and define an output
2. Need to create a schema for the data you want to load, may as well
   load all possible tables
3. A ruby runner script

schema_file: this contains object definitions with load statements
. when this is run you must define path_to_object

object1 = LOAD '<%= path_to_object1 %>' AS (<%= Object1.to_pig %>);
object2 = LOAD '<%= path_to_object2 %>' AS (<%= Object2.to_pig %>);
...
and so on






h3. hmmm, a pig runner

sudo ln -s /path/to/piggy.rb /path/to/pig/bin/piggy.rb
