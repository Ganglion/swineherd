-- Example: I want to use existing data but I want all
--          my tables to be pre-loaded, my parameters
--          already specified, i don't want to handle inputs and outputs at all!

out_node   = FOREACH a_follows_b GENERATE user_a_id;
out_group  = GROUP out_node BY user_a_id;
out_degree = FOREACH out_group GENERATE group AS node, COUNT(out_node) AS out_deg;

-- Just have to dump this at the end of every one...
STORE out_degree INTO '<%= Settings.output %>';
